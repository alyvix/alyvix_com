## **Performance** Monitoring

The end goal is to visualize trends over time with dashboards showing your end-user workflow performance. The data for this is drawn from regularly and continuously scheduled test cases, integrating their output into your own monitoring system and, finally, analysing latency and downtime to assess IT service quality. Contact us if you need support in building test cases, or their integration or maintenance.
