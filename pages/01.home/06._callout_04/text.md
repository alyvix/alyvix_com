## **Application** Monitoring

The end goal is to visualize trends over time with dashboards showing your end-user workflow performance. The data for this is drawn from the measurements of regularly and continuously scheduled test cases, and their output can be integrated into your own monitoring system, allowing you to analyze latency and downtime to assess both instantaneous and trending IT service quality. Contact us if you need support in building test cases, their integration, analysis or maintenance.
