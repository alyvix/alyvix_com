## **Test Case** Execution

The Alyvix Robot command line tool runs the *.alyvix* visual test cases you've saved: this command executes pre-recorded end-user bots that reproduce your users' workflows directly on their applications. The resulting performance measurements of those interactions are displayed both in the CLI and saved as human readable output files, containing annotated screenshots that provide demonstrable and indisputable proof whenever a test case can't be run to completion.
